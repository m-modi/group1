Problem Description:
We chose this scenario because Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services, with millions of users worldwide. The data model will allow us to better understand how various entities like songs, albums, and artists are interconnected in the system, which is highly relevant to both businesses in the music industry and tech professionals developing similar systems. With real-world applications, the model could be extended to track metrics like streams, monthly listeners, or the popularity of songs. This could serve as the foundation for building recommendation algorithms, analyzing user engagement, or making data-driven business decisions, which is crucial for the development of platforms similar to Spotify.
